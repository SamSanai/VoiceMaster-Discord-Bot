# VoiceCreateBot

Dedicated bot for creating temp voice channels with commands for changing permissions.

This bot runs on discord.py rw If you need help with the code use the discord.py server :  [https://discord.gg/r3sSKJJ](https://discord.gg/r3sSKJJ)

As there is a very high demand for me to release the source code for my bot I've finally decided to release it.

This was just a small project that got quite big, I wrote the bot in a day so the code is pretty sloppy and sadly I couldn't give a fuck and in no way shape of form I'm saying I'm a good programmer.

Enjoy the code, don't try to release it as your own bot. :)

If you'd like to support the bot you could pay for my coffee and the servers using the link below <3  [https://www.paypal.me/ssanaizadeh](https://www.paypal.me/ssanaizadeh)

**This version of the bot is sufficient enough for casual use on afew servers, I have no intention what so ever of updating it nor will support anyone with hosting it.**

**I won't be releasing the new version of the bots source code either so don't ask.**

# How to setup the bot:

1.Download python using the following link:

	https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/

2.Open command prompt and paste the following:

	  pip3 install discord.py
  
	  pip3 install validators
  
3.Download the bot from github

4. The discord token is loaded in from a config file. You will need to create this file. Create a file named **discord.ini**. That file should have the following format:
```
[discord]
token = 

```
To the right of the equals sign put your token.


5.Run the bot
